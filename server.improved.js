//Personal notes:
//HTTP requests allow interaction between frontend and backend of websites
//There must be an interaction betwwen a server and client to modify data
//HTTP methods to request data allows us to perform CRUD operations on servers: POST, GET, PUT/PATCH, and DELETE.
//Every request includes an endpoint and a type of request being sent.
//The endpoint is the path between the client and server.
//Server sends back a response depending on the validity of the request
  //If the request is successful, the server sends back data in the form of JSON.
  //If the request fails, then an error message is sent back to the client.
  //Responses are associated with status codes:
    //A status code of 200 means that the request was successful.
//Client sends the request, server recieves the request.

//GET: GET Request is used to retrieve data from the server.
//POST: POST Request sends new data to the server as an object.
//PATCH: PATCH Request is used to update certain properties of an object.
//PUT: PUT Request updates all properties of an object.
//DELETE: DELETE Request deletes data from a server.
