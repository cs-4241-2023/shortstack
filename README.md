The website will take a email, name, and birth date. once you hit the submit button it will be sent and stored in the server and you will see a message saying `Submission Successful`.
To see the data click on `Display info` this will let you see all the data layed out on a table. The table will also have a derived field called `Age` which is the claculated age based on
the birth date that was given. There is also a column of checkboxes with the header of the column called delete. Only one checkbox can be slected at a time and once you press the delete button
a message will pop up saying that the row has been deleted. Once you clear the table and display it again you can see the row is no longer there. 
-Css that was used

- table: a border and made it display in the middle of the page
- button: the button have a border and when you hover over them they transition from blue to a darker blue.
