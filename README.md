My project is a simplified digital library where the user can enter the books they've read into their library, along with the date they started it and the date they finished it. The program will calculate how long it to read the book and put that into the library as well. 

I used the CSS grid position technique. 

In order to use this web application, make sure you fill out all fields before hitting the submit button. 


<h2> Technical Achievements </h2>
Tech Achievement 1: My program provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of server-side data by always showing what's in "My Library." The client updates the data display every time there is another submission or deletion.
