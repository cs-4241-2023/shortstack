## Your Web Application Title

I created a todo list application. My application uses flexbox for body containers and button containers, as well as grid to format the form element. This todo list application creates a derived field using your dueDate input that shows priority level of your tasks.

## CSS Requirements

I used a grid to display all of the inputs in the task-form. The grid is made up of two columns and two rows, the description input stretching across two columnts using grid-column: 1 / 3. There are also many examples of flexbox, one of them being the form itself. The content-container is a flex container, the flexbox orders its child elements vertically, and centered.

Id selectors were used for the task-form and the inputs inside the form, class selectors were used for the buttons beside the tasks as well as for the many containers (button, input, and main container).

CSS defined in a maintainable, readable form, in a external stylesheet (main.css).
