Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js
Your Web Application Title
The Present Idea List I created allows you to add the name of a present you want as well as the price of that item using the "Add to Present List" button. These items are stored in a list that can be accessed using the "Go to Current Present List" button on the bottom of the page. The "Clear List" button allows you to clear the list of items that were previously added. Also, upon accessing the current list, you are able to travel back to the home page. I added color to the background of the page, as well as created a header and two spaces for you to input data. All of these are centered on the page, and there is a box created around where you can enter the data. The buttons are also centered under the input areas.

Design/UX Requirements

Ramadani, Desai
Some problems that users had with the design was that the price of the items were not showing up properly in the list page, and also the clear list button does not work properly.
Comments that they made that surprised me included that they thought there could have been more colors in the website, and also that the list page could be oriented differently.
I would take their changes to add a better color scheme, however, I would not change the layout of the results page.
