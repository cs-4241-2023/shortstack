# Todo List

This project is a dynamic Todo List application that allows users to add tasks with various details like priority, due date, and description. Users can also delete tasks once they're completed or no longer needed. The application primarily uses Flexbox for layout and positioning. This ensures a responsive and organized display of tasks and form elements.

## Technical Achievements

- **Modify Items**
  - By adding a button to each task I was able to have it such that a user can update a task by pulling the data from it into the form also deleting the old task, update the information they want to and then add the new one, easily and simply.
