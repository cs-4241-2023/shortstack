## Log Your Workout
I created a workout log where you can log your past workouts and also calculate the training volume, which is helpful in figuring out how to optimize your workouts. The volume is calculated by multiplying the amount of sets, reps, and weight lifted together. The CSS positioning technique I used is the flexbox technique. To properly calculate the training volume, you will need to fill out the sets, reps, and weight fields in the form.

## Technical Achievements
- **Created Single-Page App**: Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **User Testing 1**: Randy Huang - During the evaluation, Huang encountered an issue where if all the fields are not filled in, the submit feature is still enabled and will be logged with no information. He also mentioned that he liked the CSS styling, however the delete button did not fit with the rest of the webite styling. Based on this feedback, I would add a requirement for the user to fill all the fields for them to be able to submit the workout. I would also change the styling of the delete button to make it more cohesive with the rest of the website.

- **User Testing 2**: Kristine Guan - During the evaluation, Guan did not face an issues with the website. However, she did mention that it would be nice if the logs were ordered by the date, and not by the order of when the log was submitted. She also mentioned that it would be nice if the fields were reset after submitting so that the user does not have to edit the previous data to create a new log. From this feedback I would order the logs by date, from newer to older logs, and reset the fields to blank after submitting.

**Professor Roberts told me to mention in the README that he gave me an extension on this assignment due to me getting COVID.**
