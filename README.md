## Tier List Generator
This website is a tier list generator. Different items can be added to the tier list, each given an icon image and a numerical rating out of 100, with an auto generated tier calculated from the rating (S/A/B/C/D/F). The rating or image of an item can be modified by submitting again with the same item name, and the pencil icon button makes the process easier by autofilling the existing information. The trash can icon can be used to delete items from the list. Items persist until the server is restarted. Flexboxes are used for some parts of the layout.

## Technical Achievements
- **Editing entries**: The rating and image of an item can be edited in place by resubmitting with the same item name. A button to fill in the existing data for an entry is provided.
- **Single page site**: The site is contained within a single page, and making state changes automatically updates the list without needing to refresh.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Color coded rows**: Rows are given colors dynamically based on the tier of the item in that row.
