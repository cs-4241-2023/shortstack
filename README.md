## SIMS: Simple Inventory Management System
For my project, I created a simple inventory management system. The system takes in an item, some amount of that item, and some price per one of that item. The server side then computes what the total value is of the stock of that item and sends the value back to the client. I used flexbox to align the input form and the data table horizontally from one another. I also used a grid display to format the input form itself.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app by combining the submission form for new data and the data table into the same page. In addition to this, there are delete and modify buttons for each row of data, allowing the user to have full contol without needing to switch pages. To accomplish this, I needed to generate HTML through JS in order to keep the data table updated as data was added, deleted, or modified.
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Added the ability to modify existing data by including a 'Modify' button next to each row in the data table. To accomplish this, I implemented a uuid system in order to uniquely identify each data entry as well as add additional JS code to swap out the text displays in the table with input elements when the modify button is pressed.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: I performed a user study with one person to see how they reacted to my user interface design.
Tasks Provided:
Create a new row of data
Modify an existing row of data
Delete a row of data

Q1: Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
- *Hariyanto*

Q2: What problems did the user have with your design?
- *The user mentioned that they would like to see more color of the webpage as well as a dollar sign on the necessary fields.*

Q3: What comments did they make that surprised you?
- *The comment about adding the dollar sign surprised me because it was just something I hadn't though about. It was something that I overlooked due to spending so much time lookng at the webpage.*

Q3: What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
- *I would likely incroperate their feedback by adding more color to the website to make it look better and also add the dollar sign to indicate currency on the fields that need it.*
