Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

Due: September 12th, by 11:59 AM.

This assignment aims to introduce you to creating a prototype two-tiered web application. 
Your application will include the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Node.js functionality, with active communication between the client and the server over the life of a user session.

## The Movie List
This project creates a list of movies you want to see. You input the movie title, the length of the movie and the year the movie was released.
To add a movie, you input the fields that you desire then click the "add" button. To Delete a movie, you input the movie title and the year
and click the "delete" button. If you want to modify a movie you input the title of the movie you want to modify and the new info you want
to modify then click the "modify" button. After each click of a button the movie list will appear showing you what is in your current list.
I used the flexbox CSS positioning technique.


## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I created a single page app that provides a form for a user to submit data and in return it will show you the
current state of your movie list. This was done using fetches to the server and HTML to print on the information onto the page.

- **Tech Achievement 2**: The form not alone allows the user to add and delete information from the list but it also lets the user 
modify any of the past entries and computes a derived field called "age" that uses the movie year to show how old the movie is. This is done
after the user inputs the movie title they want to modify, the new info they want to modify and then clicks the "modify" button.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: 
The task I expect the user to accomplish is input info into the movie list input fields, click add and then see that their new movie
is added. After, I expect the user to go through and use the delete and modify buttons correctly.

2. The modify aspect was a little confusing as they weren't sure how to modify the desired movie.
3. none
4. I would add a message box that explains how to delete and modify a movie entry from the list.

- **Design Achievement 2**: 
1. Tristan Sharich
2. The modify and delete aspect was confusing as they weren't sure how to modify or delete the desired movie along with which input 
fields they needed to fill in.
3. none
4. I would add a message box that explains how to delete and modify a movie entry from the list (again). Seems like they had the idea to 
fill in the input fields and click delete or modify but they weren't entirely sure.
