# Assignment 2 - Short Stack: Basic Two-tier Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js

## RBE Attendance Tracker

This web app is the prototype the a club membership and attendance tracking
application for Rho Beta Epslion. This is intended to replace the previous
method which has stopped working and needed to be replaced. The functionality of
this website is to monitor how many community service hours the member has
completed and how many more they need to finish. There are also outlines for
future feature implementations.

This is several days past the initial due date, but I was sick and ran into many
issues during this project that delayed my progress. The main issue was not
understanding how to write to the server, but once I figured that out, I
finished the project as soon as possible.

## Technical Achievements

**Tech Achievements**:

- Using the writeInfoToScreen() function, I was able to display all of the server
  data on the page. This function takes in the parsed JSON data and then
  constructs HTML objects and inserts them into a grid to display them on screen.
- CSS sheets were used to create sidebars, insert images, and customize the
  font and other elements on screen to create a consistent user interface.

### Design/Evaluation Achievements

**Design Achievement 1**:

- Due to a long extension on the project, I was unable to get any user
  feedback. However, others, who are not in the class, found the website well
  designed and easy to use with no major feedback.
