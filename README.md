## TODO List App

https://a2-davidgobran.glitch.me

My app is a Task tracker that allows the user to create tasks with a name, due date, and description. Based on the difference between the due date and the current date, the server assigns a priority to the task from a set of predefined options. I used flexbox for my CSS. A note about my app is that it only supports deleting and modifying **one** task at a time.

## Technical Achievements
- Created single page app that updates the table when the form is submitted.
- Added ability to modify one task at a time. This can be done by checking the box next to a task, entering the updated information into the form, and clicking the 'Create/modify task' button.
