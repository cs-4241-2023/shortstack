# Achievements

### Technical

- (5 points) Create a single-page app.
  - My app is only one page and allows for both submission and retrieval of data from the node server.
- (5 points) In addition to being able to add and remove data, add the option to modify data.
  - Users are able to submit (add), clear (delete), and double (modify) app data.

### Design/UX

- Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
  - Fyock (Colin)
- What problems did the user have with your design?
  - He said that the colors clashed a lot and that changing them would be a little easier on the eyes. Specifically, the pink on green was a bit jarring. He also said that fixing the table so that the width doesn't keep changing after numbers get longer would be something worth changing.
- What comments did they make that surprised you?
  - I was surprised that he liked the spinning buttons so much. I mostly added them as a joke and to practice using CSS keystrokes.
- What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
  - If this were an applicaiton that I thought a lot of people were going to use, I would likely change the colors to complement the other better and I would make the buttons less distracting. I would also probably choose a different font.
