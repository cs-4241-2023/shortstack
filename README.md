This website features a calorie and protein tracker to make dieting easy! Simply log food entries and the calculator will determine your current calorie and protein counts and how much left towards the goal you've set.

The Server maintains a few fields for each entry: id, food name, # calories, # protein, and the derived field "protein from calories".

The form can be used to add entries one at a time, or delete all entries. In addition, it's possible to modify the server data by pressing the red X on individual entries, which modifies the data by deleting a particular entry.

The server also handles giving ids to individual entries.

Flexbox is used throughout the webpage to align the different components.

This is a single-page app where the server sends back the full data to the client after any modification.

No major feedback. Unique and cool idea. The layout is readable and easy to understand. potential suggestion is CSS styling the forms and submit button as they a little out of place

Your website looks really nice, I really like the layout and rounded corners on your containers. The colors you used for the "X left to go!" made was easy to read and very noticeable. The protein calculation is a cool feature, but I got a bit confused when figuring out what kind of food to enter because the protein value can't be 0. Ended up with broccoli with 10% protein lol. If that is intentional then making the type of foods to enter more clear would be good, or 0 as an option for the amount of protein.
