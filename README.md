## Cooperative Todo List
A todo list app that keeps track of who is assigned to tasks, as well as who did the assigning. Useful if you need to track which employee is assigned a task, and which manager assigned it.
The list automatically generates an email address from the assignee's name. This is useful to allow management to harass and nag the poor assignee via annoying Outlook notifications.
