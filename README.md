## Per Game Basketball Stat Calculator
My application allows users to input total values for games played, points, rebounds, and assists for basketball players, and the server returns their per game stats. I used flexboxes to position the elements on the page. To use the application, fill out the form with appropriate values and click submit.

## Technical Achievements
- **Single-page application**: The application provides the form for users to submit data and shows the current state of the server-side data on the same page. Whenever the user submits data, the data server sends the updated data back, allowing the client to display the current state of the data.
