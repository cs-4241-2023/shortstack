This website features a calorie and protein tracker to make dieting easy! Simply log food entries and the calculator will determine your current calorie and protein counts and how much left towards the goal you've set.

The Server maintains a few fields for each entry: id, food name, # calories, # protein, and the derived field "protein from calories".

The form can be used to add entries one at a time, or delete all entries. In addition, it's possible to modify the server data by pressing the red X on individual entries, which modifies the data by deleting a particular entry.

The server also handles giving ids to individual entries.

Flexbox is used throughout the webpage to align the different components.

This is a single-page app where the server sends back the full data to the client after any modification.

No major feedback. Unique and cool idea. The layout is readable and easy to understand. potential suggestion is CSS styling the forms and submit button as they a little out of place
