Glitch Links:

## Your Web Application Title
Include a very brief summary of your project here. Be sure to include the CSS positioning technique you used, and any required instructions to use your application.

Task Tracker App:
This short stack app was developed to allow the user to easily manage and write down their tasks/goals. The app takes user input of task name, description
due date and priority so the user can easily organize their day. I used a combination of flexbox, relative positioning and box model to style my css.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: I added the ability to see the current state of the server on the home page. Whenever someone inputs a task it is displayed
The second achievement I added is the ability to remove tasks from the todo list with the delete button.
### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**:
My app is fairly simple, Sameer Desai was given a task of adding and creating a task to server and deleting it. He commented how simplistic 
the app was to use and everything made sense because the input was organized well.
Based on their feedback I would just add some more designs and add an option to make the inputs required and also make sure that the tasks that are deleted
dont show up again when a new one is made.
