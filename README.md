## Todo List

My app is a Todo list which allows that user to create and delete tasks. Based on the due date and current date the server assigns a priority to the task. I used a grid for my CSS for my table headings. I also used CSS to make my Todo list have a free form flow as well.

## Technical Achievements

Created a single-page app that  both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. I have the server side continuosily updating with new data that is put in.

2. What problems did the user have with your design?
There weren't too many problems. Both said it was easy to use and they were able to the tasks I defined pretty easily  They said that it would have been good if they would have been able to select the amount of time that each assignment takes. 
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
They said that they liked the background color. I didn't really think to much of it when first choosing it, but both liked the shade of blue that I used. 
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?
I would add another input to see how much time each assignment takes so that data is also displayed on the page. Something really cool would be adding a bar that the user can click on and that is the amount of progress the student has made on that todo item
