## Color Palette Bank
This website provides an interactive color palette storage system, where 5 colors can be set by interacting with the 5 circles in the top form. These colors are set to black by default, and are changed by using the html color picker. I used a flexbox for the form container and the table container to center the divs horizontally.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page web app where users can add and remove color palettes, which updates for each input. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Utilized a function that determines the brightness of each color cell, and changes the hex code text to be white or black for better contrast. 
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Generated a display of each color in the color palette by setting the background color of the corresponding table cell to its hex color value. 
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Added error handling for when a new entry has the same name as an existing entry, and a pop-up that tells the user that the name already exists, as well as a pop-up if the user attempts to submit without adding a name. 
- **Tech Achievement 5**: Created a derived field that stores the contrast between the primary and secondary colors in the color palette, and sorted the data in descending order by contrast.
