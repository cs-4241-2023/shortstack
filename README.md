## Todo List
This website allows users to connect to an https server and load in data about pending tasks on their todo list. Additionally, it allows you to add, delete, and modify task data. It will also generate a priority depending on how close the task's deadline is to the current day.

### CSS Requirements
I used a flexbox to layout my 'Add Task' form. My layout uses the row flex-direction and justifies the content in the center of the window. I also used a table to neatly organize my data, which uses a element selector. 

I used id selectors with my addItemContainer and task-table, and class selectors for my addTask and addItem classes. This website is styled with the use of an external css sheet, which includes information regarding my custom font and color palette.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Created a single-page app that both provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. 
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Enabled adding data on the server.
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Will enable deleting data on the server
- **Tech Achievement 4**: Will implement ability to modify existing data.
- **Tech Achievement 5**: Used specialized inputs to collect dates
- **Tech Achievement 5**: Implemented a reset button that will clear the form

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Used a table to neatly organize task data
- **Design Achievement 2**: Used a flexbox to layout my 'Add Task' form. My layout uses the row flex-direction and justifies the content in the center of the window.
- **Design Achievement 3**: Created and used a color palette from color.adobe.com.
- **Design Achievement 4**: I used Lato as the font from GoogleFonts for the primary copy text in my site. I specified that Arial, Helvetica, and sans-serif as backup fonts.

*Design/UX*
- (5 points per person, with a max of 10 points) Test your user interface with other students in the class. Define a specific task for them to complete (ideally something short that takes <10 minutes), and then use the [think-aloud protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Think_aloud_protocol) to obtain feedback on your design (talk-aloud is also fine). Important considerations when designing your study:

1. Make sure you start the study by clearly stating the task that you expect your user to accomplish.
2. You shouldn't provide any verbal instructions on how to use your interface / accomplish the task you give them. Make sure that your interface is clear enough that users can figure it out without any instruction, or provide text instructions from within the interface itself.
3. If users get stuck to the point where they give up, you can then provde instruction so that the study can continue, but make sure to discuss this in your README. You won't lose any points for this... all feedback is good feedback!

You'll need to use sometype of collaborative software that will enable you both to see the test subject's screen and listen to their voice as they describe their thoughts, or conduct the studies in person. After completing each study, briefly (one to two sentences for each question) address the following in your README:

1. Provide the last name of each student you conduct the evaluation with.
2. What problems did the user have with your design?
3. What comments did they make that surprised you?
4. What would you change about the interface based on their feedback?

*You do not need to actually make changes based on their feedback*. This acheivement is designed to help gain experience testing user interfaces. If you run two user studies, you should answer two sets of questions.
