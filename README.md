## TODO List App

https://a2-davidgobran.glitch.me

My app is a Task tracker that allows the user to create tasks with a name, due date, and description. Based on the difference between the due date and the current date, the server assigns a priority to the task from a set of predefined options. I used flexbox for my CSS. A note about my app is that it only supports deleting and modifying **one** task at a time.

## Technical Achievements
- Created single page app that updates the table when the form is submitted.
- Added ability to modify one task at a time. This can be done by checking the box next to a task, entering the updated information into the form, and clicking the 'Create/modify task' button.

## Design Achievements
1. McInerney
2. The user had trouble modifying a task. This was because he didn't pay attention to the create button also saying modify.
3. It surprised me that he complimented my use of flexbox. He adjusted the window size which showed that the flexbox was working as intended.
4. I would change the text of the create button to 'Modify' if a task is checked. I would also populate the inputs with the data from the task being modified.
