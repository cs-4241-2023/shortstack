This project is a banking app using express, mongodb, a css framework, and a functioning login system. The page starts on a create account page. This page allows a user to input a username that doesnt exist in the database, a password that has to be entered twice and match, and a balance value. By clicking create user the application can will redirect the user to the application page. This page allows the user to deposit and withdraw from their account. They can deposit any amount but can only withdraw up to their balance. When a balance is updated, the newBalance is displayed on the screen and updated in the database. There is also a delte account button that will delete a given account and return the user to the login page. The login and create account can be switched between by clicking the already have an account and the need to create an account buttons. The login page allows an existing user to input their username and password and if correct then they will be redirected to the application page. The goal of this project was to create a much more complete and effective tool to keep track of expenses. I had a lot of challenges during this project, mainly with the location of files and the CORS policy preventing certain files from loading. This was largely due to me running my code through the vs run rather than through the node server. I also had a lot of trouble with the redirect function and had to add the window.location.href to ensure the page properly changed. I simply checked to see if the inputted password was equal to the password string created during the create account page. This was pretty simple and honestly seemed like the best strategy for checking if the password was accurate. I used the mvp.css framework to create a simple and engaging application. I did override a few of the css styles but this was mostly to acheive the 100 for each of the 4 categories in the lighthouse report. I used a lot of middleware in my server to handle certain requests. I had an app.use cookie to ensure that a logged in user could only access there account and not another. I also used app.use(expressurlencoded = true) to have the password be hidden in the url of the page. I used app.use(express.static('public')) to serve the static html and js files to the server. I also used app.use(express.json) to allow all of the passsed data to be in the form of a json object. 

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**:(5 points) Get 100% (not 98%, not 99%, but 100%) in all four lighthouse tests required for this assignment. I was able to override some css elements to center the page and add to contrast. This allowed for all 3 of my html pages to have 100s accross the board. This was somewhat challeging, especially the last few points, but with the contrast and format of the css framework and my overridden elements, i was able to create appealing and effiecient pages.

## Design/Evaluation Achievements

- **Design Achievement 1**: 
1.) Provide informative, unique page titles - Each of my html pages has a respective title that represents the process of the page. The respective titles are login, newAccount, and banking app for the login page, the create account page, and the application page. 
2.) Use headings to convey meaning and structure - The headings of the page are similar to the titles previously mentioned. There is a login page, a create account page, and a Simple banking App header to convery what functionality the user has on that specific page. 
3.) Make link text meaningful - The links that are present on the html pages are either Already have an Account? or Need an Account?. These links will redirect the user to the correct page to either create an accont or login.
4.) Keep content clear and concise - Each page only has the necessary forms, buttons, and headers. This allows for a very clear and concise webpage and the user will be able to tell almost immediatly if they are on the page they desire. 
5.) Provide sufficient contrast between foreground and background - This was largely prompted by the lighthouse requirement. Because I needed good contrast on the page i made the buttons a darker blue than was present through mvp.css. I also changed the background color to be a milder blanchedalmond to create more contrast and appealing application.
6.) Donâ€™t use color alone to convey information - I use error messages or redirects to display information to the user. Any message that displays on the screen is done so with a red color to contrast with the background and also stand out to the user. The color alone is not enough to know what is wrong, so i also included the passed in data in many of the applicable error messages.
7.) Ensure that form elements include clearly associated labels - All forms on the page are concisely and clearly labled to inform the user of the expected input. I also have the input types set to only allow certain inputs into the fields, such as balance can only be a number.
8.) Associate a label with every form control - Every form input field has a corresponding label to better identify the inputs that are expected and the corresponding fields. These labels consist of username, password, REpassword, balance, and withdraw/deposit. These allow the user to know exactly what they are putting in for what.
9.) Help users avoid and correct mistakes - There is a lot of error handling present within the application to steer the user along the right track. For example, when a user creates an account, the program will check if that username already exists, and if it does it will return an error essage instead of a redirect. There are any error messages present that will prevent the page from impropery formatting data and the user from accidentally inputting incorrect fields.
10.) Ensure that interactive elements are easy to identify - All interactive elements on the page are either input fields with clearly marked labels, or highly contrasted buttons with specific labels to let the user know what each button does. The error handling also ensure that the user is inputting the correct information and pressing the proper button to perform a desired action. 
11.) Provide clear and consistent navigation options - The user has a few options to redirect between pages. When on the login or create account page, the user can freely switch between the pages by using the anchor link at the bottom of both pages. The application page also has a logout link to return the user to the login screen. The user can also automatically redirect to the proper page if they input the proper information into the forms present.
12.) Use headings and spacing to group related content - The headings are seperated and larger from the rest of the fields, allowing the user to easily identify what form they are attempting to fill in. I also include breaks in the account that allow for the input fields and buttons to have enough space to easily be accesed by the user.
