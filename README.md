## Your Web Application Title
This project is a streamlined single-page web application designed to help users manage their daily tasks efficiently. 
Using CSS Flexbox for layout design, the application offers a seamless user experience with real-time updates on task additions and modifications.

In this application:

Checkbox: Each task comes with a checkbox allowing users to mark tasks as completed, providing a clear view of task progress.
Priority: Users can set a priority level for each task, helping to identify and focus on high-priority tasks first.
Date: The creation date of each task is automatically recorded, helping users to track their tasks over time and manage deadlines more effectively.

## Technical Achievements
Form Submission: Users can add tasks through a form. The server processes this data, including a derived field based on the task's creation date and priority, and updates the client-side data display in real-time.
Data Display: The app constantly shows the current state of server-side data, including the newly calculated derived field.
Editing Data: Users can modify existing tasks directly within the app, with changes reflected instantly on the server.
