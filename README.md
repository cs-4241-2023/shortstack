Random number "game". 

Create player name and color with form inputs. Then "game" generates a random number between 1-100 for the score. Then this player info name, color, score gets sent to server.

Server creates rank derived field by looking at all player's score and assigning rank for each player. Now all players info gets sent back to client and displayed under Results section with added rank derived field.

Then user can delete players with delete button which deletes player info on server and server also fixes rank of all players. 

Then user can edit player name with edit button which edits player info on server and will change all players with that name.

NOTE: Need to scroll down to see results. Not enough time to fix :(
