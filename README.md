# Recipe Tracker

Recipe Tracker is a web application that allows users to track their recipes. Users can add new recipes, delete existing recipes, and view their recipe list. The application utilizes CSS Grid for layout and incorporates Google Fonts for improved typography.

## Tasks

### Base Assignment 1: Implementing Recipe Tracking

- Developed a server that serves files and maintains a tabular dataset with fields related to recipes.
- Implemented a Results functionality that displays the entire dataset residing in the server's memory.
- Created a Form/Entry functionality, allowing users to add or delete recipe items residing in the server's memory.
- Incorporated Server Logic that adds a derived field, "Cooking Time," to new recipe entries based on existing fields like "Ingredients" and "Directions."

### Base Assignment 2: HTML and CSS Styling

- Utilized HTML forms for user input, with various form tags for recipe details.
- Designed a results page using HTML tables to display recipe data.
- Ensured all HTML pages validate, and provided easy navigation between pages.

### Base Assignment 3: CSS Styling and Positioning

- Styled primary visual elements of the application using CSS.
- Demonstrated the use of CSS selectors, including Element selectors, ID selectors, and Class selectors.
- Utilized CSS Grid for layout, providing an organized and responsive design.
- Defined custom fonts using Google Fonts, enhancing the overall typography of the application.
- Maintained CSS styles in external stylesheets for readability and maintainability.

### Base Assignment 4: JavaScript Integration

- Implemented front-end JavaScript to fetch data from the server, ensuring real-time updates when users add or delete recipes.
- Created a seamless user experience by updating the data display dynamically upon interactions.

### Base Assignment 5: Node.js HTTP Server

- Developed an HTTP Server using Node.js to serve all necessary files and data for the application.
- Generated the required Derived Fields, such as "Cooking Time," on the server-side, enhancing the dataset.

## Achievements (Just tech)

- (5 points) Created a single-page app that provides a form for users to submit data and always shows the current state of the server-side data. The server responds by sending back the updated data (including the derived field), and the client updates its data display in real-time.
- (5 points) Implemented the ability to modify existing data in addition to adding and deleting data on the server, enhancing user flexibility and functionality.
