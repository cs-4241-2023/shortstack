## Basketball player rating calculator

For my project, I decideded to make a calculator to find an overall player rating based off of a few variables: Outside shooting score, Inside shooting score, athleticism, playmaking, and defense. Each varaible is on a scale from 0-99. Each variable is weighted and then averaged to get the player's overall rating. Use the tabs at the top of the web page to add, delete, or update a player entry in the table.

I used a flex box for the tab container (flex direction column) as well as the contatiner holding the tabs and the inputs (flex direction row). I used class names for contatianers as well as elemments like the tab buttons, and ids for the input fields in order to get the user inputted text.

I used the Rubik google font for all of my webpage text.

## Technical Achievements

- **Tech Achievement 1**: All of the nessesary components and data is all displayed on one page. I use a tab switcher to switch between the add, delete and update functionality. The table is updated accordingly on each http request.
